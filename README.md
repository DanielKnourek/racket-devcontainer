# racket-devcontainer
This is a VS Code development container for the racket.

# Reminder
When devcontainer start first time, I try to modify [magic-racket](https://github.com/Eugleo/magic-racket) extension.js file to make racket-langserver work correctly. See context [here](https://github.com/Eugleo/magic-racket/issues/51)
